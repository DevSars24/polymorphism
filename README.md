# 🔁 Mastering Polymorphism in C++ — All-in-One Project

This C++ project is a complete demonstration of **Polymorphism** — one of the four core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It covers both **Compile-Time** and **Runtime Polymorphism**, with clear code examples, real-life analogies, and in-depth explanations.

## 📚 What is Polymorphism?

> **Polymorphism** means "many forms" — a single interface or function behaving differently based on the context.

It allows us to:
- Use **one name** to perform **different tasks**
- Write **flexible** and **scalable** code
- Work with objects more **abstractly** and **cleanly**

---

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine pressing the **"Start" button**:
- On a **TV**, it turns on the screen
- On a **Car**, it starts the engine
- On a **Washing Machine**, it starts cleaning

You pressed the same button, but behavior differs depending on the machine — that’s **Polymorphism**.

## 🔄 Types of Polymorphism in C++

| Type              | Description                                        | Examples                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Compile-Time**  | Resolved during compilation                        | Function Overloading, Operator Overloading |
| **Runtime**       | Resolved during program execution (at runtime)     | Virtual Functions, Method Overriding |

## 🧾 Code Examples Included

### ✅ 1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism**

#### a. Function Overloading

```cpp
class Calculator {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
    int add(int a, int b, int c) { return a + b + c; }
    float add(float a, float b) { return a + b; }
};
🔍 Explanation:
Same function name add, but different parameter types or counts. The compiler decides which to call based on arguments.

b. Operator Overloading
cpp
Copy
Edit
class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;

    Complex(int r = 0, int i = 0) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    Complex operator + (const Complex& other) {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }
};
🔍 Explanation:
We’ve overloaded the + operator to work with user-defined Complex objects.

✅ 2. Runtime Polymorphism
a. Using Inheritance + Virtual Functions
cpp
Copy
Edit
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        cout << "Some animal sound\n";
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        cout << "Dog barks\n";
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        cout << "Cat meows\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a1 = new Dog();
    Animal* a2 = new Cat();

    a1->makeSound(); // Dog barks
    a2->makeSound(); // Cat meows

    delete a1;
    delete a2;
}
🔍 Explanation:
Even though we call makeSound() on an Animal*, the correct derived class function is executed — decided at runtime.

💻 Sample Output
yaml
Copy
Edit
Function Overloading:
Sum of 2 and 3: 5
Sum of 1, 2, 3: 6
Sum of 1.5 and 2.5: 4

Operator Overloading:
Sum of complex numbers: 6 + 8i

Runtime Polymorphism:
Dog barks
Cat meows
🔍 Key Differences Summary
Feature	Compile-Time Polymorphism	Runtime Polymorphism
Resolved At	Compile Time	Runtime
Based On	Function Signature	Object Type
Performance	Faster (decided early)	Slightly slower (late binding)
Flexibility	Less flexible	Highly flexible & extensible
Examples	Overloading	Virtual Functions, Overriding

🚀 Why Use Polymorphism?
Write generic code that works with any object type

Add new classes easily without changing existing code

Use interfaces and base classes to simplify complex systems

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: C++

Compiler: g++, clang++, or any modern C++ compiler

Platform: Console / Terminal

📘 Bonus Tip
Use abstract base classes when you want to enforce that all derived classes must implement certain methods. This ties polymorphism with abstraction for maximum power.
